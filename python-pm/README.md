# Python Package Manager Testing

I'm interested in 3 different python package managers:

- Poetry (most familiar)
- pdm (least familiar)
- uv (familiar with ruff)

Which one is faster?
Better pep and standarized supports?
Actively maintained?
Speed of:

- setup
- venv creation (optional)
- speed of downloading packges from lock files
- speed of creating lock files
- lockfile formats / pep supports

Basically, I want to pit these 3 pieces of software together.

I'm thinking of making dockerfiles, either with all of them installed, or one per container.

## Dockerfiles / Images

Base image? :
Benchmarking / testing tools?:
ENVs?:
